# ⚕️ HealthSync AI

HealthSync AI is a clinical decision support system that uses machine learning to predict possible medical conditions based on user-selected symptoms.

This project was developed as part of an AICTE virtual internship and focuses on combining AI, healthcare concepts, and modern UI design into a practical application.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects symptoms from the interface.
2. Symptoms are converted into a binary feature vector.
3. A trained machine learning model analyzes patterns.
4. The system predicts probable conditions with confidence scores.
5. Results are displayed in a clinical-style dashboard.
